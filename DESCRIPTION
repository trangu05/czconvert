Description: Provides crosswalks and helper functions to map Public Use Microdata 
    Areas (PUMAs) from the U.S. Census (2000, 2010, 2020 vintages) into commuting 
    zones (CZ90). Functions support both many-to-many mappings (using allocation 
    factors) and one-to-one mappings (dominant CZ per PUMA). This package is 
    useful for economists and social scientists working with ACS or Census 
    microdata who need to aggregate individual records to consistent local 
    labor market areas.
